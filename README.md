# Lupine: Linux in Unikernel Clothes

## NOTE
The container image for building the kernel (Linux 4.0) is not available anymore but you can use an older Ubuntu image to build it. We use apline-variant applications that use musl-libc for our benchmarks. PRs are welcomed!

In this project, we manually configure the Linux kernel so that it becomes
as small as 4+MB. We aim to show that it has the following unikernel properties
- no mode switching (by KML)
- specialization (by Kconfig)
- size (by evaluation)
- efficiency in terms of boot time and memory density (by evaluation)

## Contribution
- a combination of existing Linux configuration specialization and KML
  for a first-step Linux unikernel
- an evaluation of what unikernel properties are achieved
- a discussion of common unikernel tradeoffs (e.g., no smp, no fork)
  and their impact
- highlighting next steps for Linux specialization/ cross domain
  optimization

## Setup
1. Clone project:
`git clone https://github.com/hckuo/Lupine-Linux.git`

2. Update submodule:
`git submodule update --init`

3. Pull a docker image that contains the environment for building Linux 4.0 kernel, and create a tag `linuxbuild:latest`. Run the below commands:
    * `docker pull a74731248/linuxbuild:latest`
    * `docker tag a74731248/linuxbuild:latest linuxbuild:latest`

4. Run `make` command in the content `load_entropy` to generate `load_entropy` file
5. Build the Lupine unikernel of your interest by following ***one*** of the below steps:
    * run `sh scripts/build-kernels.sh`
    * run `sh scripts/build-with-configs.sh configs/<specific_config> <app_config>`  
       For Eg: `sh scripts/build-with-configs.sh configs/lupine-djw-kml.config configs/apps/nginx.config`
7. Build rootfs:
`sh image2rootfs.sh app tag ext2`, the tag must be `alpine`, because Lupine use musl libc rather than glibc.
 Example: `sh image2rootfs.sh nginx alpine ext2`

## Run Lupine-Linux
### In Firecraker
- run `sh firecrackerd.sh` in first shell
- run `sh firecracker-run.sh <path_to_kernel> <path_to_rootfs> init=<init_script>` in second shell, the `init` can be `/bin/sh` or some scripts that you want to run after Lupine boots up.

### In QEMU
- Make sure to build your kernel with the follwing options turned on:
    * `CONFIG_PCI=y`  
    * `CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI=y`
- Once built you can run using the following command:
  `qemu-system-x86_64 -no-reboot -kernel <path_to_kernel>  
  -drive "file=<path_to_root_fs>,format=raw,if=none,id=hd0" 
  -nographic -nodefaults -serial stdio
  -device virtio-blk-pci,id=blk0,drive=hd0,scsi=off
  -append "panic=-1 console=ttyS0 root=/dev/vda rw loglevel=15 nokaslr init=<init_script>`

```
scripts
|-- build-kernels.sh (build all kernels for helloworld, redis and ngnix for all variants)
|-- firecrackerd.sh (wrapper firecracker daeomn)
|-- firecracker-run.sh (wrapper of firecrakcer client)
|-- image2rootfs.sh (create userspace root fs from docker image)

> Theses scripts should be executed at the root directory.

## Takeaways:
- don't rewrite Linux unikernel people!
- know what unikernel benefits you really care about and what you give
  up to get them
- future work should be on app manifests LTO, etc.

## Going forward beyond unikernel restrictions
- smp vs. non-smp
  - smp gives speed benefits, esp when CPU bound
  - may cause size overhead (different config)?
- fork vs. non-fork
  - same as smp just may add context switches (show in microbenchmark)
- (how many applications use fork?)
- dynamic linking vs. static
- with KML unikernel properties "gracefully degrade"
